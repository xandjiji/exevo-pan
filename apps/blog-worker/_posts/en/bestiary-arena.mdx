## Bestiary Arena 

Almost two years ago we started developing our most ambitious project: <ExternalLink href="https://bestiaryarena.com/?tag=exevoblogen">a browser game, inspired by Tibia</ExternalLink>.

The game is currently still being soft-released, but it already has a ton of content and we are close to 2,000 registered players!

We are close to a full release of the game, but you are invited to play it right now!
